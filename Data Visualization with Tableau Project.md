# Data Visualization with Tableau Project

## Hotel Customer Retention Analysis Story

The presentation uses a visualization method similar to storytelling. As the story unfolds, it introduces key insights that guide the audience through the process of addressing the business question. The objectives of the project are explained in the [Project Proposal](https://github.com/yl5787/tableau-specialization/blob/main/Project%20Proposal.pdf).

Prior to analysis, the [data](https://github.com/yl5787/hotel-booking-demand/blob/main/data/hotel_bookings.csv) was verified to be free of cleanliness issues.

KPIs are created to track customer retention metrics. Visualizations with KPIs deliver analytical insights that focus on the key metrics and reach out to other elements that may be related. Slides are user-interactive, allowing the audience to select, filter, compare, or get additional information from tooltips. 

The multi-frame data story begins with an introduction to the business purpose of the project, followed by concise yet comprehensive visualizations that provide a straightforward view of the analysis, and concludes with data-driven business recommendations that can be integrated into the company's marketing strategies.

[Project Reflection](https://github.com/yl5787/tableau-specialization/blob/main/Project%20Reflection.pdf) examines whether and how the goal is demonstrated throughout the presentation.
