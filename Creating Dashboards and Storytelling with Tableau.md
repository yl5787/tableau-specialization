# Creating Dashboards and Storytelling with Tableau

## Profitability Dashboard

This dashboard enhances the use of KPIs. KPIs stand for Key Performance Indicators and are a measure of how well an organization is performing compared to its strategic goals and objectives. Well-designed KPIs provide the navigational tools that give a clear understanding of the current levels of performance. <br>
A KPI must be designed in ways that make sure they are based on strategic needs. It must be well-defined, quantifiable, and crucial to the goals that the organization wants to achieve so that it acts like some sort of performance marker such as profit, reliability, or other attributes. There needs to be some calculation that allows a quick way to indicate the performance of the target attribute. KPIs are the key metrics that provide answers to the business question and the indicator or decision triggers that will flag any key performance that falls outside the bounds set using pre-attentive attributes that access the user's short-term memory space. <br>
In this dashboard, the KPIs were created by using calculated fields and building a figure that measures progress in the data. From the point of view of a data analyst in a marketing and sales unit, a KPI that shows Sales by Category and Region was first created based on the [Superstore Sales dataset](https://github.com/yl5787/tableau-specialization/blob/main/data/Sample%20-%20Superstore%20from%20Tableau.xls). The KPI displays an O if sales are above $125,000 and an X if sales are below $125,000. This threshold could be set wherever appropriate for the business standard or situation. <br>
Then, more KPIs were created all around profitability. Profit Ratio was calculated by dividing the sum of profit by the sum of sales. This is a primary KPI that any company would be using in order to track business performance. The next KPI, Profitability KPI, was created by using a calculated field based on another calculated field already created, which is Profit Ratio. If Profit Ratio is greater than a third, Profitability KPI displays GREAT. Else, if it's above 10%, then OK. Otherwise, it displays BAD. This Profitability KPI indicates profit performance in colors in multiple visualizations across the dashboard.

It is not demonstrated in the above dashboard, but Tableau Server offers data-driven email alerts to audience members if a specific threshold has been breached. A threshold may have been passed when a particular area is hitting the benchmark, and this is what the KPIs may be involved with. Both thresholds for alerts and KPIs are set based on strategic needs of an organization and the audience members should be notified in case of issues with either of them. <br>
Therefore, KPIs should be as real-time as possible. There should be either a connection to data that is refreshed on a regular basis or some other way of refreshing it in a fairly straightforward way, such as an ODBC connection. Accompanying regular updates is a way to keep the data up-to-date and let the audience know that the information is as fresh as it possibly could be. <br>
An example of a visualization in which this function would come in handy is the [control chart](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/yl5787/viz/ControlChartforSuperstoreSales_16281951129100/ControlChart) from the [Essential Design Principles for Tableau](https://github.com/yl5787/tableau-specialization/blob/main/Essential%20Design%20Principles%20for%20Tableau.md) course. Oftentimes, control charts are used in manufacturing environments that ensure quality control over something that is produced. So the widget comes into effect along the assembly line. If an issue crops up, the audience would know as quickly as possible whether there had been a defect, so that it could be taken out and gotten rid of. In this control chart, a parameter has been created that allows to measure performance within a set number of standard deviations. If it's outside of that standard deviation, then it might be a problem. The threshold is the standard deviation line, and the alert is the change in color that occurs when a record is outside of the line. <br>

## Discounted Sales and Profitability Analysis

The goal of this project is to perform an exploratory analysis of the [Superstore discount data](https://github.com/yl5787/tableau-specialization/blob/main/data/Full%20Sales%20Superstore%20Dataset.xlsx) for Sylvia, the VP of Sales. She is currently reviewing the company’s discount policy and has asked to investigate if there is a relationship between discounted sales and profit. The key focus is to provide a clear answer to the following business question: Are discounted orders more or less profitable than non-discounted orders?

Initially, a [Design Checklist](https://github.com/yl5787/tableau-specialization/blob/main/Design%20Checklist.pdf) was created to guide the exploration of the data. The KPIs were then established to track key indicators and identify meaningful relationships. Next, the narrative arc was drafted using the Three C’s: Context, Challenge, and Conclusion. Lastly, the final deliverables were prepared for Sylvia to present the analysis to company stakeholders.

The KPIs were designed around the primary objective of the project, which is the Profitability of sales. The Profitability KPI indicates "GREAT" if it is greater than 0.33, "OK" if it is greater than 0.1, and "BAD" otherwise. The data story is designed and developed around the Profitability KPIs, analyzing discounts, categories, regions, sales, and profit in relation to Profitability. The KPIs demonstrate the use of visual and cognitive principles, particularly pre-attentive attributes, with a strategic emphasis on color.
