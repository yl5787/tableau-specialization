# Fundamentals of Visualization with Tableau

This course examines the fundamental concepts of data visualization and explores the Tableau interface, identifying and applying the various tools Tableau has to offer.

## London Bus Safety

This visualization is designed interactive, so users are expected to click on a borough to get started. This is to make the visualization less overwhelming and minimize cognitive load when users open the visualization. Based on the London bus incidents data provided by [Transport for London](https://tfl.gov.uk/corporate/publications-and-reports/bus-safety-data), bar graphs, line graphs, and a treemap have been created for various attributes, but they don't appear until a user's click has been recognized and a borough selected. Once they click on a borough on the Incidents by Borough bar graph on the left, five visualizations for the corresponding borough appear on the right. Tooltip displays additional information as they hover over the graphs. The dashboard consists of six visualizations in total, with simplified graph features for a cleaner look and a better insights delivery.

## Final Project: #MakeoverMonday Global Conflicts

The task is to participate in a #MakeoverMonday project and make over an existing visualization into a better one. The original visualization for the [The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project](https://www.acleddata.com/data/) in 2018 is a map chart with incidents marked with circles as shown below.

The above visualization is not visibly clear, let alone deliver the data-driven insights which is the quantitative scale of incidents by type in this case. So I chose to use a stacked bar chart instead, with colors representing the types of incidents. Visualization has become cleaner, simpler, and easier to interpret data and understand the findings.
